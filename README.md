# WebMBuilder

WebM Builder is a simple Web interface made to generate shell scripts for simple VP8 WebM video encoding with FFMPEG.
Enter the encoding parameters on the page and download the resulting script. Run it with FFMPEG in the same directory
or the system path.

Timecoder easily runs locally in any modern Web browser with Javascript enabled. It is also hosted [online](http://cyprienne.me/webmbuilder/).

For more advanced and multi-platform WebM encoding, see [Webbum](https://github.com/rzumer/Webbum).
