# WebMBuilder

WebM Builder is a simple Web interface made to generate batch scripts for simple VP8 WebM video encoding via `FFmpeg` on Windows.
Enter the encoding parameters on the page and download the resulting script. `FFmpeg` must be accessible via the `PATH` environment variable or be in the same directory.

WebM Builder easily runs locally in any modern Web browser with Javascript enabled. It is also hosted [online](https://rzumer.tebako.net/webmbuilder/webmbuilder.html).

For more advanced and multi-platform WebM encoding on the desktop, including VP9 and AV1 support, see [Webbum](https://github.com/rzumer/Webbum).
